Project: Landing Page from The Odin Project

As the title suggests, I will be replicating the landing page provided in the foundations lesson as seen here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page#project-solution where I will be demonstrating all the skills I have learned such as HTML, CSS and now Flex/Flexbox
I will be adding my own style to the landing page so it is not an exact match.
